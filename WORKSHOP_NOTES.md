## 🎯 Why Build a Personal Website (from IMG_7904)

### Ask the Audience

## ⏳ Before AI - Two Options (from IMG_7904)

### Option 1: Build Your Own → Learn Code
- Time-consuming (months of learning)
- Full control but steep learning curve

### Option 2: Pay Someone
- Expensive ($$$)
- Or use Drag & Drop builders

### Drag & Drop Era
- **Wix** (2006) - $$ per person
- **WordPress** (2003) - More technical
- **Squarespace** - Templates
- Still required: **Hosting & Domain**

### The Cost Breakdown
```
Code yourself → Free but TIME
Wix/Squarespace → $$ monthly
Hire someone → $$$ expensive
```
